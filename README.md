The "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Zomato Dataset" project focuses on analyzing data from Zomato to uncover insights and trends that can inform restaurant business strategies and customer preferences. 
By leveraging Python for data analysis and visualization, the project begins with loading the Zomato dataset into a Python environment using Pandas. The data cleaning process addresses missing values, removes duplicates, and standardizes fields. 
The data is then transformed to facilitate analysis, ensuring it is in a suitable format. EDA is conducted to explore various aspects such as the distribution of restaurants across different cuisines, ratings, and price ranges, and the relationship between restaurant ratings and variables like location, cuisine type, and cost for two.
Visualizations are created using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, with charts like histograms, bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots to represent findings. The project utilizes Python, Jupyter Notebook, and various data visualization libraries to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Zomato landscape, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions regarding
restaurant operations and marketing strategies.
